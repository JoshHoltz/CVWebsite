      <h2>CSY1063 Thoughts</h2>
        <p>Throughout this project, I have learnt a lot through various different ways, from lecture learning to the process of trial and error, but overall, I have found this project both enjoyable but with some parts being challenging and intricate. 
          In addition to formal lecture work I really liked the ability to not just be tested in a TCA but to put my learning to actual through a project by creating a website which will serve a purpose throughout my whole university journey and further. This created a healthy blend between theory and practical learning where I think I learn the best. 
        </p>
      <h2>Coding Review</h2>
        <p>Through CSY1063 there have been enjoyable coding moments, particularly from making enhanced design animations. However, there was also a fair share of moments of frustration, like when code outputs an unexpected outcome â€“ subsequently leading to a smashed phone screen. 
          Parts where I have been most proud of my code must be when it comes to the advanced CSS selectors where I was able to child selectors such as:not(:first-child) to @media screen elements which allowed me to optimise my website for mobile, despite these coding concepts being completely new to me I was able to become confident with it to be able to use it effectively in desktop and mobile optimisation.  
          Another area in which assisted me a lot was by allowing myself to plan how I would like the website to look and start of by thinking about the grid layout and how it will need to be to be presented to be effective in a website.  
        </p>
      <h2>Futrue Work</h2>
        <p>In my future work, there would be some changes I would make. For example, when coming to plan my website I would next time be a bit more agile with the development so I am not stuck and fixed to my plans just so I can give myself a bit more leeway in the designs and adaptability of the project. 
          However, overall, from what I have learnt in the project I would like to follow the good practices and standards that I have been taught so I am ready to make effective industry-standard websites.
